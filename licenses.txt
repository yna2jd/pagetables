1. The GNU Public License v3. The GPL, as it is known, provides strong protection for software released under it.
Its comprehensive language provides patent protection, prevents resale of the software itself, and removes a problematic violation clause of GPL v2.
However, should you release software under the license, you must be prepared to provide anyone with the source code of your software.
Additionally, any software that uses or modifies the work would inherit the license, which protects it further.
It is the strong and comprehensive protections of the GPLv3 that encouraged me to include it in the project.

2. The MIT License is much more permissive than the GPL. With it anyone can sell, distribute, include and otherwise use your software.
The license's inclusion of commercial use means that technically someone could sell a wrapper to your free software and people would be none the wiser.
However, there's also no question that the license is short and sweet. It is flexible, quick to understand and limits restrictions.
So, if you're making open source software, it minimizes the headache of worrying about licensing.

3. The CC0 license is a copyright relinquishing license.
Making your work effectively public domain, the CC0 license means that you hold no trademark or limitation to it.
While one might expect that this license would be short, it is in one of the longest, using its "three-tier" system to limit legal repercussion.
Thus, complete with a Waiver and Public License fallback, the CC0 license is a great option for sending your creation free into the world,
should that be your desire. Personally, I like my name associated with my work, which is why I elected against this one.
